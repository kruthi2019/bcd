Breast Cancer Detection
MOTIVATION:
To evaluate movtivational factors for pqarticipation in a breast cancer screening program and concurrently examine beliefs regarding carcinoma of the breast held by those women, we took records and datasets from wisconsin diagnostic dataset.
OBJECTIVE:
Breast cancer has been characterised as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognisiness of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Detection of breast cancer in women in early stages that help them to sucessfully overcome it.
REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS:
PLATFORM USED:machine learning
DATASET USED :Wisconsin dataset
LANGUAGE:Python 
IDE:Anaconda

ALGORITHMS:
SVM algorithm
Support Vector Machine‚Äù (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well.In Python, scikit-learn is a widely used library for implementing machine learning algorithms, SVM is also available in scikit-learn library and follow the same structure
